Tempo v1.0.0 - Complete Systems Programming Language

Major release: Tempo can now replace C entirely for OS development!

New Features:
- Struct support with memory layout control (@packed, @align)
- Pointer types: safe bounded pointers ptr<T,N> and raw_ptr<T>
- Inline assembly support for hardware control
- Complete type system: int8/16/32/64, bool, arrays, unions
- String and character literals
- Enhanced control flow: for loops, break, continue
- Arrow operator (->) for pointer field access
- Array indexing and field access operators
- Module system foundation

Compiler Enhancements:
- Full recursive descent parser with precedence climbing
- Complete expression parsing for all operators
- Enhanced code generation for x86 assembly
- Improved WCET analysis for new constructs
- Better error reporting with line/column info

This release marks a revolutionary milestone - AtomicOS can now be
written entirely in Tempo without any C code. The language provides
zero runtime overhead, deterministic execution, memory safety, and
direct hardware control when needed.

"No more C needed!"
